# DadJoke

This simple app is just for fun. :smile:

## Features

This is built using .NET 9.0 and C# 10.0. It uses the DadJoke API to get a random dad joke and display it in the console. I'm using an API that doesn't require any authentication. This fetches a random Dad joke and displays it in the console. Here's the link to the [Dad Joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke).
